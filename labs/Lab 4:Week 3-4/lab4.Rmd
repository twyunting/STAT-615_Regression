# R Lab 4
- Read the build-in cars dataframe
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cars #dist = distance
```
- Plot the two variables, independent variable is Speed (in Miles Per Hour) and dependent variable is Stopping Distance (in Feet).
```{r}
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
xlab = "Speed (in Miles Per Hour)", 
ylab = "Stopping Distance (in Feet)", 
main = "Stopping Distance vs Speed", 
pch = 20,
cex =2,
col = "grey")
```

```{r}
stop_dist_model = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) 
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
     xlab = "Speed (in Miles Per Hour)",
     ylab = "Stopping Distance (in Feet)",
     main = "Stopping Distance vs Speed",
     pch  = 20,
    cex =2,
    col = "grey")
abline(stop_dist_model, lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
```

## Fit the model
```{r}
stop_dist_model = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) 
summary(stop_dist_model)
```

## Tests in R
- find the `coefficients` table so we use `names` function to see the all tables in summary.
```{r}
names(summary(stop_dist_model))
```
- We can find b0 = -17.579095 and b1 = 3.9324088 from the coefficients table below. 
- b0 and b1 are the estimators for the model by $\beta0$ and $\beta1$.
```{r}
summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients
```
## $\beta1$
- Let we focus on $\beta1$ first so we need to extract $\beta1$ row.
```{r}
summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients[2, ] #[row, column]
```
- Estimate b1 is 3.932409e+00
- Standard error of b1 is 0.4155128
- t-value, which is testing for null hypothesis.
- p-value = 1.489836e-12

## $\beta0$

- Extract $\beta0$ row from coefficients table
```{r}
summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients[1,]
```

## create new factors 
```{r}
stop_dist_model_test_info = summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients
b_0 = stop_dist_model_test_info[1, 1] # Estimate 
b_0_se = stop_dist_model_test_info[1, 2] # Std. Error 
b_0_t = stop_dist_model_test_info[1, 3] # t value 
b_0_pval = stop_dist_model_test_info[1, 4] # Pr(>|t|)

b_1 = stop_dist_model_test_info[2, 1] # Estimate
b_1_se = stop_dist_model_test_info[2, 2] # Std. Error 
b_1_t = stop_dist_model_test_info[2, 3] # t value 
b_1_pval = stop_dist_model_test_info[2, 4] # Pr(>|t|)
```

## Manually Task
- t-statistic for b1 by hand
```{r}
(b_1 - 0) / b_1_se
```

- From coefficients table
```{r}
b_1_t
```

- p-value by hand
```{r}
2 * pt(abs(b_1_t), df = length(resid(stop_dist_model)) - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

- From coefficients table
```{r}
b_1_pval
```

## Significance of Regression, t-Test
- For the `cars` example:
  + Under H0 there is not a significant linear relationship between speed and stopping distance. 
  + Under H1 there is a significant linear relationship between speed and stopping distance.
  
That is, we need to know the expected value of b1 is an unbiased estimator for $\beta1$. We set H0 : $\beta1$ = 0 vs H1 : $\beta1$ != 0. With the small p-value, we have evidence to reject the null in favor of alternative hypothesis. Thus, the $\beta1$ is not equal to zero so there is a significant linear relation between `Speed (in Miles Per Hour)` and `Stopping Distance (in Feet)`.

## Know what is the linear
```{r}
set.seed(42)
x = seq(-1, 1, 0.01)
y = 5 + 4 * x ^ 2 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 0.5) 
plot(x, y, pch = 20, cex = 2, col = "grey") 
abline(lm(y ~ x), lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
```
- Let we run the linear model and set: H0 : $\beta1$ = 0 vs H1 : $\beta1$ != 0
- With the large p-value 0.756 explained below, we fail to reject the null. In other words, there is no significant linear relationship between x and y.
```{r}
regSec <- lm(y~x)
regSec
summary(regSec)
```

## Confidence Intervals in R
Using `confint` function then we can smoothly get the confidence intervals for $\beta0$ and $\beta1$.
```{r}
# 99% cinfidence interval
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)
```
- In this case, if the car increase in 1 mile/per hour, the Stopping Distance (in Feet) will increase in 2.817919 to 5.0468988 feet with 99 % confidence interval. We have 99% confident to explain it.

## Extract the results separately
```{r}
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[1,]
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[1, 1]
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[1, 2]
confint(stop_dist_model, parm = "(Intercept)", level = 0.99)
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[2,]
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[2, 1]
confint(stop_dist_model, level = 0.99)[2, 2]
confint(stop_dist_model, parm = "speed", level = 0.99)
```

## Verify that calculations that R is performing for the $\beta1$ interval.

```{r}
# store estimate
b_1 = coef(stop_dist_model)[2] # store standard error
b_1_se = summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients[2, 2] # calculate critical value for two-sided 99% CI
crit = qt(0.995, df = length(resid(stop_dist_model)) - 2) # est - margin, est + margin
c(b_1 - crit * b_1_se, b_1 + crit * b_1_se)
```
