# R Lab 4

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cars
```

```{r}
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
xlab = "Speed (in Miles Per Hour)", 
ylab = "Stopping Distance (in Feet)", 
main = "Stopping Distance vs Speed", 
pch = 20,
cex =2,
col = "grey")
```

```{r}
stop_dist_model = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) 
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
     xlab = "Speed (in Miles Per Hour)",
     ylab = "Stopping Distance (in Feet)",

     pch  = 20,
    cex =2,
    col = "grey")
abline(stop_dist_model, lwd = 3, col = "darkorange")
```

## Fit the model
```{r}
stop_dist_model = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) summary(stop_dist_model)
```

## Tests in R
```{r}
names(summary(stop_dist_model))
```

```{r}
summary(stop_dist_model)$coefficients
```
