1. (6.3) A student stated: “Adding predictor variables to a regression model can never reduce
$R^2$, so we should include all available predictor variables in the model.” Comment.
- Not really. If the model have a bigger $R^2$ value, which means the fitter is better. However, better fitting does not necessarily imply the fitted model is a useful one.

2. (6.4) Why is it not meaningful to attach a sign to the coefficient of multiple correlation R,
although we do so for the coefficient of simple correlation $r_12$?
